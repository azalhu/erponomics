improved state conversion between `Item` and `proto::Item`

23:25
reflected over current situation

23:26
realised sidestep. started with looking into `prost::Name` implementations,
but ended up implementing item state conversion to protobuf,
after reading about `oneof` implementations as enum in `prost`

23:28
return to `prost::Name` implementation. needed for
`google.longrunning.Operation` implementation

23:39
listened to the zookeeper's boy by mew. great number. kinda dreamy

implemented trait `prost::Name` on `proto::Item`, adding cargo-crate
`prost-build` as a build dependency. by calling
`prost_build::config::Config::enable_type_names(&mut self)`
